abstract = {SHARE is a unique panel database of micro data on health, socio-economic status and social and family networks covering most of the European Union and Israel. To date, SHARE has collected three panel waves (2004, 2006, 2010) of current living circumstances and retrospective life histories (2008, SHARELIFE); 6 additional waves are planned until 2024. The more than 150 000 interviews give a broad picture of life after the age of 50 years, measuring physical and mental health, economic and non-economic activities, income and wealth, transfers of time and money within and outside the family as well as life satisfaction and well-being. The data are available to the scientific community free of charge at www.share-project.org after registration. SHARE is harmonized with the US Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) and has become a role model for several ageing surveys worldwide. SHARE's scientific power is based on its panel design that grasps the dynamic character of the ageing process, its multidisciplinary approach that delivers the full picture of individual and societal ageing, and its cross-nationally ex-ante harmonized design that permits international comparisons of health, economic and social outcomes in Europe and the USA.},

abstract = {AbstractBackground Little is known about country-specific variations in suicidal ideation (SID) by sex and how they correspond with completed suicide rate. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to assess variations in {\{}SID{\}} prevalence rates by sex and its correlation to completed suicide rates across European countries. Method {\{}SHARE{\}} is a cross-national European survey of individuals over the age of 50 and their spouse of any age. The present study relied on wave 4 conducted in 2010–2012 including 49,008 participants aged 55 to 104 years from 16 countries. {\{}SID{\}} was evaluated using a single item from the Euro-D. Data on completed suicide rates were taken from the {\{}WHO{\}} mortality database. Results Of the study population (n = 49,008, 44.3{\%} men, mean age 68.2 ± 9.1 years), a total of 4139 (8.5{\%}, 95{\%} {\{}CI{\}} 8.2–8.7) reported suicidal ideation within the last month. The women:men ratio in {\{}SID{\}} prevalence ranged from 1.30 in Estonia to 2.25 in Spain and Portugal. Regarding country-specific variation, the {\{}SID{\}} prevalence patterns of both men and women did not correspond to the completed suicide rates for males and females aged 55+ reported by the {\{}WHO{\}} (2013). Correlations were rather moderate in men (r = 0.45) and especially weak in women (r = 0.16). Conclusion The study showed remarkable differences in {\{}SID{\}} prevalence by sex. The most exciting finding was that {\{}SID{\}} rates did not correspond with completed suicide rates in each country under investigation. However, the strength of these patterns substantially differs across countries. This unexpected finding need to be further evaluated.},
